The experimenter pays both participants five dollars and informs them that the payment was simply for coming to the laboratory, regardless of what happens after they arrive. Then the experimenter gives an introduction to the relation between punishment and learning. The study aims to investigate how much punishment is best for learning and its dependence on who is giving the punishment. You and Mr. Goombas drew slips of paper from a hat to determine who would be the teacher and who would be the learner in the experiment. You are the teacher and Mr. Goombas is the learner. Immediately after the drawing, the experimenter takes you and Mr. Goombas to an adjacent room and straps Mr. Goombas into an electric chair apparatus. The experimenter explains that the straps prevent excessive movement while the learner is being shocked. It appears impossible for the learner to escape from the situation. The learner, Mr. Gommbas, asks a question and the experimenter answers that the shocks are extremely painful but cause no permanent tissue damage. The experimenter then leads you into the shock generator room. You are seated in front of an instrument panel with 30 lever switches clearly labeled with voltage designations ranging from 15 to 450 volts. There is a 15-volt increment from one switch to the next. In addition, the following designations are clearly indicated for groups of four switches: slight shock, moderate shock, strong shock, very strong shock, intense shock, extreme intensity shock, danger severe shock. Two switches after this last designation are simply marked XXX. The experimenter gives you a sample shock of 45 volts (slight shock) on the shock generator to give his obj a sense of how it feels. You note that the shock feels painful. The experimenter leads you through a preliminary run of the procedure. The experimenter gives you a list of questions. You should read a question and wait for the learner to select an answer. If the learner selects a correct answer,you should move on to the next question. If the learner selects a wrong answer, you should announce the current voltage level and shock the learner before reading the next question.
